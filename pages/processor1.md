title: How to Build a Processor from Scratch - Part 1 - Setting Goals
---

I've long been fascinated by the workings of intricate complex systems.
Railways, Rube Goldberg machines, particle physics, aircraft, galaxies;
you name it, I've probably spent more time reading/watching YouTube videos
about it than most women in the prime of their twenties.
And what better example of this than the brain of the modern computer:
the central processing unit? How _does_ a chunk of silicon no bigger
than a Rich Tea make so much magic happen?

* understanding = visualisation + getting your hands dirty
* motivation = learning + sharing knowledge + art
* past attempts -> need use case
* processor use case = kernel
* kernel use case = ???
