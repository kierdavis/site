I've finally figured out how to compile this website for the first time in a few years, so expect updates here!

### Blog posts

* [How to Build a Processor from Scratch - Part 1 - Setting Goals](processor1.html)
* [Computing sin & cos in hardware with synthesisable Verilog](cordic.html)
* [malloc4: a simple implementation of malloc](malloc4.html)

#### I'm Sorry

I've always sucked at writing prose - words just don't come naturally to me.
I've put off writing these articles for far too long due to the fear of
committing to finishing them to a self-acceptable standard, and I'm realising
that putting crappily-formatted knowledge out there is preferable to not putting
anything out there at all.

What does this mean? It means these posts are a continuous work in progress,
as opposed to being "published" at some specific point in time. Expect bullet
points, too-much-coffee ramblings, and sections that don't really follow from
one another, until I happen to re-read it a few years later and realise a
better way to rewrite it.

It also means these might take a long time to get to the point of actually
being useful to anyone. The DIY processor project for example has been an
ongoing project of mine since about 2012, and is still in the early design
stages. I'm working on some looooooooong time scales here.

### Elsewhere on the web

* Observe me in curious yet impractical clothing [here][ig-modelling]
* Adopt the aforementioned clothing once it becomes starved of my attention [here][depop]
* Confirm for yourself that I am in fact Kier Ada Davis [here][keybase] (don't take my word for it)
